This reposotory is a full working example of how to call Clojure code from
Java. To compile and run the code just execute make from this directory. You
should see output like:

    rm -rf classes/*
    java -server -cp "./lib/*":./src clojure.main -e "(compile 'com.domain.tiny)"
    com.domain.tiny
    javac -cp classes -d classes src/Main.java
    java -cp "lib/clojure-1.3.0.jar:classes" Main
    (binomial 5 3): 10.0
    (binomial 10042, 111): 4.9068389575068143E263

If you would like to see the compilation configuration open up the Makefile.
This is the information that I found lacking in other explainaintaions of how
to call Clojure from Java. Though it may be obvious to a seasoned Java dev.

The code used is originally (as best I can tell) from:
